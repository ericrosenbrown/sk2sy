	Generate the symbolic vocabulary
	Psuedocode on page 237 (23)

	The pseudocode checks whether we can make a symbol from a 
	factor based on whether
		Project(e, fi) âˆ© Project(e, f \ fi) = e

	This works fine when we can enumerate all states, and all of e
	However, when we only have sampled states, we need to use an approximation
	MFNOTE: TODO Explain what goes wrong if we try this directly without approximation

	We will instead train two e classifiers: one based only on fi, 
	and one based only on  \bigcup (f \ fi)
